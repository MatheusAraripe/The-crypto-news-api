# The crypto news api

For my [crypto project](https://github.com/MatheusAraripe/The-Cryptopedia) I used an API that provides news about cryptocurrencies, however I noticed the lack of reference media vehicles. 
We live in a generation with a large volume of information, at all times we are victims of false information and fake news. Therefore, 
I decided to create my own api that pulls news from the most reputable newspapers around the world.

For this API IS used node.js and got the news from 9 different journals. It is available on [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/matheusalc2001/api/crypto-news30/).
